    <h1>When Faith Meets Tragedy</h1>
    <p><em>By Anirudh Vinayak Metri</em></p>
    <p>It was a quiet morning in February when I stood with my family on the banks of the Ganges, the air thick with incense, chants, and devotion. We had come to Prayagraj for the Maha Kumbh Mela — the world's largest spiritual gathering. But beneath the surface of the sacred rituals and holy dips, there was an unshakable undercurrent of dread.

    <h2>A Question for Us All</h2>
    <p>Can we continue to accept loss as collateral in spiritual pursuits? Or is it time the world takes the safety of religious gatherings as seriously as their sanctity?</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
    <p>In February, I traveled with my family to attend the Mahakumbh — a journey that was meant to be spiritual, but which quickly became emotionally overwhelming. At the start of the year, I had come across troubling predictions — ominous forecasts that hinted at possible mishaps during this sacred gathering.
